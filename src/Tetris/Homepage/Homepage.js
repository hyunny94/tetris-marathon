                        <li>Scoring system has been improved. Now, soft drop is rewarded with 4 points, hard drop 8 points, and consecutive tetris (4 lines clear) are rewarded 1.5 times more. So the first tetris is rewarded with 800, but the second one with 1200. </li>
                        <li>Sounds are being added. This update includes block drop and combo sounds. Please let me know if you have a mp3/wav file that can be used for a sound effect in the game. </li>
